# Investigating the Role of Lem2 in Dilated Cardiomyopathy  
### Transcriptomic Analysis and Nuclear Morphometry

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline and interactive visualisation tools developed for the MSc Research Project titled:  
**"Investigating the Role of Lem2 in Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Transcriptomic Analysis and Nuclear Morphometry"**

The project aims to explore how the **Lem2 p.L13R mutation** perturbs gene expression programs and nuclear architecture in a murine model of neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). 
It comprises:
1. Longitudinal direct RNA-seq analysis¬†of mouse hearts (E18.5, P1, P3)
2. Machine learning-based nuclear segmentation¬†of light-sheet microscopy images
3. Interactive data exploration¬†via R Shiny dashboard
