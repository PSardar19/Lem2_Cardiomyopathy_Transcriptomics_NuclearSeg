# RShiny Dashboard for Transcriptomic Exploration

This interactive dashboard provides a streamlined interface to explore gene expression and pathway enrichment dynamics in **Lem2-mediated Dilated Cardiomyopathy**. Built using **modularised RShiny components**, the dashboard is scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend.

---

## üß© Modules Included

The dashboard is divided into distinct, self-contained modules ‚Äî each designed to visualise a key aspect of the transcriptomic analysis. All modules support outputs from both **NanoSeq** and **FLAMES** pipelines.

### üîπ Stagewise DGE Module
- Summary statistics with interactive volcano plots  
- Filterable & downloadable DGE result tables  
- Comparison across all developmental stages and both pipelines  

### üîπ Temporal DGE Module
- Volcano plots & MA plots for developmental transitions  
- Temporal expression trajectories for selected genes  
- Interactive filtering and export of results  

### üîπ GSEA Module
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GO BP, Hallmark)  
- Stagewise and temporal enrichment results  
- Cross-condition comparisons (WT vs Mut)  
- Visualisation of pathway enrichment across stages and transitions

---

## üì• Data Input & Flow

- The dashboard visualises results generated from the **DirectRNASeqAnalysis/Analysis/** directory.
- Before being loaded into the dashboard, all analysis outputs are **restructured into dashboard-friendly formats** using scripts provided in the `DataPrep/` folder.
